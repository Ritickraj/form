<p>abhishek sharma creates history, breaks sanath jayasuriya's record; becomes first player to hit 15 or more sixes in asia cup edition</p>
<p><i>Abhishek Sharma </i>continued his explosive form in the Asia Cup 2025 and slammed a 25-ball fifty against Bangladesh at the Dubai International Stadium. This was his second consecutive fifty in the Asia Cup, having previously scored 74 against Pakistan. Sharma has been a brute force for India in T20I cricket and has already established himself as one of the best modern-day players. <b>Sharma</b> retained his No.1 ranking in T20Is and reached 907 rating points, which is the third highest ever among Indian players after Suryakumar Yadav (912) and Virat Kohli (909).</p>

            <P>Meanwhile, Abhishek was in a six-hitting mood against Bangladesh and hit five sixes before being run out for 75 in 37 balls. Sharma also smashed five sixes against Pakistan, and the carnage against Bangladesh took his tally of sixes in the Asia Cup to 16, which is the most sixes in a single Asia Cup edition. The record was previously held by Sanath Jayasuriya, who had scored 14 sixes in 2008.</P></aside>
